# Real-estate-machine-learning-model
First need to train a Machine Learning model like in every Machine Learning problem you solve. After training model, below is the process to follow to turn Machine Learning model into an end-to-end solution using the dash framework:-
  1.Set up a new Dash application.
  2.Create the layout of the app using Dash’s HTML and Core Components. It includes input fields, buttons, and output display areas.
  3.Write callback functions to define the interactivity of the app, such as taking user inputs, running the model prediction, and 
   displaying the results.
  4.Load the model within the app to use for predictions.
So, the process starts with building a Machine Learning model. Using https://github.com/vashistha01/Real-estate-price-prediction 
Using the model already trained to predict the real estate prices to build an end-to-end solution.
1. Reading the dataset and training the model.
2. Creating an end-to-end solution for our Machine Learning model by using the dash framework.
3. Code of dash and HTML.
4. Code, “dash” is the main Dash library. The html and dcc (Dash Core Components) are used to create HTML and interactive components. 
   The Input, Output, and State are used for creating callbacks in Dash (interactivity).
